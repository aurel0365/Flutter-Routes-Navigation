# Navigation_Codelab 🚀

Welcome to the "navigation_codelab" Flutter project! 🎉  
This project was created as part of the **Routes & Navigation** codelab. The goal of this project is to build a Flutter application with multiple screens and implement navigation between them using various methods.

## 📜 Objective

The objective of this codelab is to guide you through building a Flutter app with multiple screens and navigation between those screens. By the end of this codelab, you will have built an app with different routes and learned how to navigate efficiently between screens.

## ✨ Features

- **Multiple Screens**: This app includes multiple screens demonstrating navigation in Flutter. 📱
- **Route Management**: Screens are connected via navigation routes, showcasing the `push` and `pop` navigation techniques. 🔄
- **Button Interactions**: Buttons on the screens trigger navigation actions between screens. 🔘
- **Navbar**: A navigation bar at the top of the app, providing quick access to various sections of the app. 📍
- **Drawer**: A side drawer menu that allows users to navigate between different screens easily. 🗂️

## 🖥️ Screens

This app consists of five main screens, each with its own purpose and functionality:

1. **First Screen**: The main screen featuring a self-image and a button to navigate to other screens. 🌟
2. **Second Screen**: This screen explains your portfolio and allows you to navigate back to the first screen. 💼
3. **Third Screen**: A screen that shows your personal activities and organizational involvement with a button to return to the first screen. 🗣️
